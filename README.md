# Coursework_Example_Projects


Includes Projects completed as part of graduate and undergraduate coursework. 

1) Election_2020 (completed in 2023)
	- Python code in Jupyter Notebook file explores the CCES 2020 survey data and analyzes voter registration and sentiment around gun control policies. Creates 3 figures in folder.

2) NYTs_API (completed in 2023)
	- Python code in Jupyter Notebook file that scrapes articles related to SAG-AFTRA published in the last few months from the New York Times Article Search API. Code cleans the data in the JSON 	files to pull out key information for each article, and saves the data within a dataframe. Results contained within .csv file in folder.

3) Predicting Neighborhood Walkability using Machine Learning (completed in 2024)
	- Python code in Jupyter Notebook that uses data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Census Bureau to predict whether neighborhood demographic features and commuting behavior can predict the neighborhood walkability. Analysis takes place at the Census Block Group level. Datasets unable to be added to the github due to their size.
	- Final Report that describes the data cleaning, compares the results of the different modeling techniques, and indicates the overall findings is included in folder. PDF Document was created using Quarto. 

4) Structural Topic Modeling of Text Data using qualitative and quantitative metadata (completed in 2024)
	- Created a structural topic model of english-language movie plots using quantitative metadata (i.e. release year) and metadata arrived from other text features (movie taglines). 
	- Published a shiny app in R that provides a walkthrough of how to implement a structural topic model and review the results: https://ppol5202-dataviz-ksl84.shinyapps.io/PPOL5205_ProjectShowcase/

5) Analyzing Differences in Student Academic achievement on Standardized Tests across race and region in North Carolina (completed in 2017)
	- R file explores student academic achievement in grades 3-8 in North Carolina. Analyzes student achievement gap based on age, race, and region in NC.
        - Added PPT slides that contains figures generated from the R code and explains the different regression models. 

6) Exploration of Academic Majors (completed in 2017)
	- R File (math_associated_studies_minors.R) analyzes and graphs students in the undergraduate math major and minor program to determine other official courses of study. 
	- Creates math_associated_studies_minors.jpeg and math_associated_studies.png graphs
